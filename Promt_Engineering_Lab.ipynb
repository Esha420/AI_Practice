It goes beyond generic dream dictionaries by learning the user's individual symbols, recurring themes, emotional connections, and even correlating dream content with real-life events, mood, and physical activity (integrated via wearable data).\n",
            "    *   **Specificity:**  The AI would be trained on a vast dataset of dream symbolism, psychology, and personal data.  It would use NLP to extract key elements from the dream narratives, sentiment analysis to gauge emotional tone, and image recognition to interpret sketches.  The \"interpretation\" engine would be modular, allowing users to customize their interpretive framework (e.g.,\n",
